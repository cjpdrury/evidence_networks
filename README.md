# evidence_networks
Producing evidence networks to compare CAMELS cosmological models via Bayes factors

evidence_network_galaxy_properties.ipynb contains the first notebook. Simulated galaxies from two models with properties stellar mass and stellar metallicity are analysed. A tuned evidence network is compared to density estimator methods. 

evidence_network_galaxy_photometries.ipynb follows from this. Simulated galaxies from two models with sloan photometric data are analysed. A tuned evidence network is compared to density estimator methods. 

evidence_network_optuna.ipynb is the file used to tune the network using optuna. 
Network tuning.pdf contains the tables used to monitor tuning progress.
